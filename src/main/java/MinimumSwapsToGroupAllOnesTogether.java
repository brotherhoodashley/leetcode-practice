/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-group-all-1s-together/
 * <p>
 * Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.
 * <p>
 * Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
 * [1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
 * [0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
 * [0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
 * The minimum is 1.
 * <p>
 * Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.
 * <p>
 * Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
 * <p>
 * Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1]
 * Output: 8
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= data.length <= 105
 * data[i] is 0 or 1.

     * Approach: Keep track of number of ones in a sliding window of fixed size, number of zeroes present would be the no of swaps required
     * <p>
     * We can optimize the space complexity by not precomputing the no of 1's present in a subarray but rather use sliding window
     * to calculate no of 1's. Maintain a sliding window of fixed size and increment/decrement the count while moving the window
