 * <p>
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T
 * that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
