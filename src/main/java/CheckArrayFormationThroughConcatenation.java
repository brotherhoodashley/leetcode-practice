/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/check-array-formation-through-concatenation/
 * <p>
 * You are given an array of distinct integers arr and an array of integer arrays pieces, where the integers in pieces are distinct.
 * Your goal is to form arr by concatenating the arrays in pieces in any order. However, you are not allowed to reorder the integers in each array pieces[i].
 * <p>
 * Return true if it is possible to form the array arr from pieces. Otherwise, return false.
 * <p>
 * Input: arr = [85], pieces = [[85]]
 * Output: true
 * <p>
 * Input: arr = [15,88], pieces = [[88],[15]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Concatenate [15] then [88]
 * <p>
 * Input: arr = [49,18,16], pieces = [[16,18,49]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Even though the numbers match, we cannot reorder pieces[0].
 * <p>
 * Input: arr = [91,4,64,78], pieces = [[78],[4,64],[91]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Concatenate [91] then [4,64] then [78]
 * <p>
 * Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], pieces = [[2,4,6,8]]
 * Output: false
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * The integers in arr are distinct.
 * The integers in pieces are distinct (i.e., If we flatten pieces in a 1D array, all the integers in this array are distinct).
