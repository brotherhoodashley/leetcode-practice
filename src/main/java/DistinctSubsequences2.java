/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/
 * <p>
 * Given a string S, count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of S .
 * <p>
 * Since the result may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * <p>
 * Input: "abc"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
 * <p>
 * Input: "aba"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aa" and "aba".
 * <p>
 * Input: "aaa"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * S contains only lowercase letters.
 * 1 <= S.length <= 2000

    /**
     * Approach: Optimized DP, if there were no duplicates, and there are 10 subsequences ending at index i, there will be 20
     * subsequences ending at index i+1, because for char at index i+1, we can extend the previous 10 subsequences by adding char at index i+1
     * So dp[i] = 2*dp[i-1]
     * However duplicate chars makes things harder for everyone except my pp, because if we extend the previous 10 characters by adding cur character,
     * it will double count some of the substrings, specifically the substrings that were added by adding the previous occurrence of the same character
     * e.g consider ycaxa
     * for first a, it added 4 subsequences to the previous 4 subsequences ending at c {"", y, c, yc} by adding 'a' {a, ya, ca, yca}
     * now for second a, it can make the same 4 duplicate subsequences too. so we have to remove the no of subsequences ending before the
     * previous occurrence of the current character
     * dp[i] = 2*dp[i-1] - dp[last_occurrence-1]
     * Its a bit tricky to visualize but try to solve it on paper for "ycaxaa" to get a clearer picture

     * Approach: Similar to solving other subsequences problems by trying to extend previously computed result
     * Care must be taken to handle duplicate characters. This is where I got confused and lost the war, as I couldn't figure out
     * how to make sense of the duplicates
     * e.g "aba"
     * [0] -> 1 {a}
     * [1] -> 2 {b, a(b)}
     * [2] -> 3 {a(a) (default +1 will handle it), b(aa), ab(a)}
     * when comparing a char with previous char, if it's same skip it. it will still work because of default +1
     * for remaining chars, it will act as adding the repeated chars e.g baa
