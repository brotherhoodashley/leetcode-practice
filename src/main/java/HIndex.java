/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/
 * <p>
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
 * and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * <p>
 * Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
 * received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 * Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
 * two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
