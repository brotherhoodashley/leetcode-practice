3rd Round: Architecture
Design a visualization tool to represent the heatmap of drivers on the map. Need to provide a way to zoom in/zoom out over the map.
Followed the pattern of dividing map into grid/cells and assigning them a cell id. Use key/value store to represent frequency count of cells -> no of cars
1. How to assign a lat/long to a cell id ? Initially I told to use maths and binary search to find the cell id. Then told to precompute everything because
no of cells can be very huge
2. How to represent point of reference and zoom units to properly aggregate the data when zoom-in and zoom-out? Could not cleanly implement it.
Was a bit tough
