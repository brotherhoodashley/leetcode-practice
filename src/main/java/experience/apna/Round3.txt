A little bit about my experience at Amazon. He asked about the 10x developer training session and was curious to know more.
I was caught a bit off-guarded and took me some time to regain the boat.

1. Given a user, create a repository
2. List all repositories created by a user.
3. Given a repository, star it.
4. Return starred count of a repository. (Reverse indexes?)

Overall a pretty chill round.
