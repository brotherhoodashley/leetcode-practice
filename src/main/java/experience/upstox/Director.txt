Had a 1 hour discussion with a director who seemed like a non-technical person
He was not at all interested in knowing about the optimizations project that I worked upon in my career so far and said that reducing latency
is easy as you have to add cache and reduce redundant service calls. He was mostly interested in whether I worked on adding any new feature.
I have to think a bit and finally came up with notifications feature on EWC.

He then proceeded to ask about the team structure and what role did I play. Overall I was getting the vibe that he was trying to judge
whether I led others in my team or not.

In the end he asked my strengths and weaknesses. Why Upstox? What other companies have I applied to? Why not applied to Zerodha?
Do you know about Upstox?

I am 99% confident that I am rejected after this final round :D
