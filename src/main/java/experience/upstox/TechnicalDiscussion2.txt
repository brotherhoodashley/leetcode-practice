Implement queue. Luckily solved a similar question {@link DesignCircularQueue} in LeetCode Monthly challenge, so was able to swiftly solve the problem including
followups like thread safety and support for primitive data types. Used an Integer[] instead of int[] as underlying store to check for null, hence the question.
Explained that we can support primitives by using another variable to denote capacity.
This was done in ~30 minutes.

Rest 40 minutes was spent digging on my past projects.
1. How did you reduce memory footprint in FlatFileLoader? Cache and Stream processing
2. Day to day responsibility? Didn't properly answer this question as I have not prepared to answer this question.
3. Design patterns used? Singleton, Builder, Factory. Real life examples of Decorator pattern.

Overall it went well.
