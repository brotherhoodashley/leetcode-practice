1. Variant of 2 Sum. Given an array containing values and a target, find pairs such that their sum equals target.
Need to consider unique pairs e.g. {3,9} and {9,3} are duplicate but {6,6} is okay.
Solved it via hashmap containing keys and their frequencies. Made sure to look in one direction ie. given k, find (target - k) > k exists or not

2. Segment tree. Given Q queries with each query containing a range L and R with a value V, increment the A[i] from A[L] till A[R] inclusive by V.
Return the max in A[i] after performing Q queries
