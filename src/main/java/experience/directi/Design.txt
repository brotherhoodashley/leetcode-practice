Design Round
Create a platform that supports generating business metrics like click through rate, impressions for images
and can support queries like how many clicks for this image where location is bangalore and gender is male

I was able to generate data ingestion platform but struggled a lot in data aggregation as I was trying to do it
in-memory or in key/value store itself. Later after talking to shashwat realized that it's a data warehouse
operation and would require a different data store itself in which you need to push data to spark that can aggregate data.

Feedback of this round was not positive but due to strong positive feedback in DSA and probably machine coding round,
I was given a second chance to ace another design round. They were keen on hiring me as a SDE2 but given my current CTC and YOE,
probably they thought SDE3 would be an appropriate level.

Feedback from recruiter:
Good in tech and has a good understanding on technologies that he knows.
Has experience in distributed systems and has solved problems around it.
He does have some idea around architecture but not able to justify the choices.
Poor trade-off skills and not able to pick hints when pointed
Designing systems that can scale and follow good design principles - Can do better.

Retrospective:
I struggled a lot as it never occurred to me to visualize this problem as a data aggregation problem and I was trying to do all operations in-memory
which caused a headache to me during implementation phase. This would have been better solved using lambda architecture
similar to design top k problem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-XDoPjoHw
There should have been a fast path and a slow path

Design Round - Another chance
Design Cricinfo platform to support realtime events like score and commentary to end users

Explained using websockets, where we would store a list of webclients that are interested in a match_id
Then use pub-sub mechanism (kafka) to push events of a specific match to all the interested websockets
Also used an in-memory store e.g. redis or aerospike to maintain a sorted dataset for commentary to give info for fresh user

Feedback from recruiter:
Non Functional Requirements which we agreed on:
high available
eventual consistency
ready heavy

Came up with a design that was not focused on core of the problem.
-Couldn't tradeoff b/w socket vs polling at server end.
-Couldn't give justification for using kafka in b/w (which was not necessary)
-Couldn't get deep into any component
-Did not touch upon data flow part until asked

Retrospective:
The miss on my part was I did not clarify the expected latency of our platform. I assumed that the platform must be instantaneous and
should be fault tolerant.
In order to add fault tolerance, I added Kafka for which the interviewer questioned me, why kafka? Why can't we simply say "try again later"?
I told that the customer experience would be broken but I guess the interviewer was ok in taking this hit.

In order to support instantaneous update, I resorted to push mechanism using socket without clarifying does the platform needs to be fast?
I guess he was okay with a delayed update and his preference was to reduce load on the platform.

Lesson learnt the hard way, would have definitely cracked this round but due to miss in requirement gathering, over optimized the problem.
