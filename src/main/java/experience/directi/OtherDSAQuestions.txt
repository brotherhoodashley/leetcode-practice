N villages in a straight line

L[i] location of ith village, P[i] population  of ith village

open K covid test centres in some of the villages

every person visits the nearest centre

find the minimum average distance possible


Ex :

L[i]
P - 1      L - 5        D = 4

Int var=INT_MAX;

(i,k,prev)
O((n^2)*k)
fun(int i, int k, int prev, int ans){

if(k==0){
 //handle it later
 var=min(var,ans);
return;
}
i
//here i have two choices
//choice 1
//open a village here

Int curr=loc[i]
Int mid=(curr+prev)/2;
//tot=Compute the total people at distance >=mid
temp=0
For all village location(d) between prev and curr {
	temp+=pop[k]*min(d-prev,curr-d);
}
fun(i+1,k-1,curr, ans+temp);

//choice 2
//do not open a village here

fun(i+1, k,prev,ans)
}



Your students are gonna attend a quiz. You need to share answers to as many questions as possible with all your N students adhering to following conditions
-> A student can receive an answer of at most 1 question from you.
-> Students convey the answer received from you to their friends.
-> Students don't pass the answers received from their friends i.e. for below graph if you give an answer to student 1, they will share it with student 2 and student 3. But 4 won’t get it from anyone.
-> Students can receive any number of answers from their friends.
-> An answer is considered successfully shared with students only if it becomes known to each of them.

Goal : Determine the maximum number of answers that can be successfully shared with students.



E.g: For above graph answer is 3.
Explanation : Let a1,a2,a3 be the answers. You give a1 to 1 and 4,  a2 to 2, a3 to 3 and. Then everyone would be having all the three answers. Hence the answer is 3 for this graph.

Constraint is N = 15

List of groups that are proper

{2} {3} {1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{2,4},{3,4},{2,3},{1,2,3},{2,3,4},{1,2,3,4}
For each node, it’ll be checked if its able to find all the nodes and answers could be shared or not.
Then find all nodes with other nodes and group them all
Done for other nodes similarly
Then groups are found
Then among groups, Check set with unique nodes
All the group with unique nodes are used to send answers


Consider all subsets of graph and check if it’s proper or not



Given an array find number of subarrays, whose sum is zero?
