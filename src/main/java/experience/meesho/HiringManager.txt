Design a system which recommends resellers to buy specific products based on their reason of purchase.
e.g If a user bought a product from reseller for someone's birthday, remind him every year couple of weeks earlier to buy some gift.

I went with a complicated approach of storing all attributes and their relationship in a graph database.
ie. extract attributes from all events that are being generated and adjust the weights accordingly.

Seems like the hiring manager didn't like my solution as I went with a complicated design and could not recommend products.
Simpler design would be to just take a text input from user, do just string processing and based on some conditions e.g. if message contains
birthday, recommend it every year.

Recruiter feedback: Positive feedback in the technical rounds. Design round didn't went well.
REJECTED.
