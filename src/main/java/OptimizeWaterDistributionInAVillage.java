/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/optimize-water-distribution-in-a-village/
 * <p>
 * There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.
 * <p>
 * For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i], or pipe in water from another well to it.
 * The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes, where each pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost] represents
 * the cost to connect house1 and house2 together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.
 * <p>
 * Find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
 * The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= n <= 10000
 * wells.length == n
 * 0 <= wells[i] <= 10^5
 * 1 <= pipes.length <= 10000
 * 1 <= pipes[i][0], pipes[i][1] <= n
 * 0 <= pipes[i][2] <= 10^5
 * pipes[i][0] != pipes[i][1]

    /**
     * Approach: Create a new hidden node that is connected to all the villages with cost wells[i] and then create a MST
     * <p>
     * In my initial thought process, I knew I have to create a MST but didn't know which well to pick from, so I greedily chose
     * the well with lowest cost and then tried to create MST until the cost to connect pipe > placing a well
     * My plan was to try to create MST from each unvisited well, I don't know whether it will work or not !
     * <p>
     * To see kruskal implementation for MST which is based on union find algorithm, refer to {@link ConnectingCitiesWithMinCost}
     * {@link MinimumCostToConnectSticks} related minimum spanning tree problem
