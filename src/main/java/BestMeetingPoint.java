/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/best-meeting-point/
 * <p>
 * A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance. You are given a 2D grid of values 0 or 1,
 * where each 1 marks the home of someone in the group. The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
 * </pre>
 * Output: 6
 * <p>
 * Explanation: Given three people living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2):
 * The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance
 * of 2+2+2=6 is minimal. So return 6.
