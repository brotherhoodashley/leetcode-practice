/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/
 * <p>
 * Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of
 * push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.
 * <p>
 * Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
 * push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
 * push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
 * <p>
 * Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.

     * If yes, keep popping until the constraint satisfies
