/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/
 * <p>
 * A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
 * <p>
 * Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.
 * <p>
 * The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
 * <p>
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 1 or 5
 * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
 * or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
