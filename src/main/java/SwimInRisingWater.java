/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/
 * <p>
 * On an N x N grid, each square grid[i][j] represents the elevation at that point (i,j).
 * <p>
 * Now rain starts to fall. At time t, the depth of the water everywhere is t. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square
 * if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distance in zero time.
 * Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.
 * <p>
 * You start at the top left square (0, 0). What is the least time until you can reach the bottom right square (N-1, N-1)?
 * <p>
 * Input: [[0,2],[1,3]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
 * You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
 * You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
 * When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
 * <p>
 * Input: [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation:
 * <pre>
 *  0  1  2  3  4
 * 24 23 22 21  5
 * 12 13 14 15 16
 * 11 17 18 19 20
 * 10  9  8  7  6
 * </pre>
 * The final route is marked in bold.
 * We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * 2 <= N <= 50.
 * grid[i][j] is a permutation of [0, ..., N*N - 1].
