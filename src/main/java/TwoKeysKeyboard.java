 * <p>
 * Initially on a notepad only one character 'A' is present. You can perform two operations on this notepad for each step:
 * <p>
 * Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the notepad (partial copy is not allowed).
 * Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
 * <p>
 * Given a number n. You have to get exactly n 'A' on the notepad by performing the minimum number of steps permitted. Output the minimum number of steps to get n 'A'.
 * <p>
 * Input: 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * Initially, we have one character 'A'.
 * In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
 * In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
 * In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The n will be in the range [1, 1000].

     * Approach: Tricky DP, consider each index as the point in which we perform "copy all" and then use that to update all indices
     * that can be generated using a "paste" operation ie. if we have currently 10 words in the screen in x operations, if we copy and paste
     * we can get 20 words in x+2 operations, 30 words in x+3 operations...
     * <p>
     * Happy to solve this on my own.
