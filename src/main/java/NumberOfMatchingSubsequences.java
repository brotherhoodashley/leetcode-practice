 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences/
 * <p>
 * Given string S and a dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of S.
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * S = "abcde"
 * words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
 * The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
 * The length of words will be in the range of [1, 5000].
 * The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].

     * Approach: Maintain a mapping of character to the words that are waiting for that character. Iterate string and for each character,
     * check which words can be satisfied, once the initial char is satisfied of a word, create a new mapping for the next character of the word.
     * e.g  ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"], "a"->{"a","acd","ace"}, "b" -> {"bb"}
     * this mapping means if 'a' is found in the string, it can satisfy three words
     * once a is seen, now "a" is completely satisfied, "acd" and "ace" will need to wait for "c". So updated mappings are
     * "b" -> {"bb"}, "c" -> {"cd","ce"}  //"a" has been satisfied and there are no words that require a
