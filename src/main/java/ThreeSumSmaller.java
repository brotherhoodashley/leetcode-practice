 * https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-smaller/
 * <p>
 * Given an array of n integers nums and an integer target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n
 * that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.
 * <p>
 * Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
 * [-2,0,1]
 * [-2,0,3]

     * 1 + 5 = 6 < 7, this means that we have found 3 valid tuples (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), increment low
     * 2 + 5 = 7, reduce high
     * 2 + 3 = 5 < 7, one valid tuple (2, 3) increment low
     * terminate

     * Took me a lot of time to think about this and then got WA due to the behaviour of Arrays.binarySearch()
     * Arrays.binarySearch() returns the index of number >= target but we are interested in number < target
     * It could have worked if there were no duplicates, then (idx - 1) would have been our candidate but if input array contains duplicate
     * we would have to loop backwards to verify and find the smaller candidate
