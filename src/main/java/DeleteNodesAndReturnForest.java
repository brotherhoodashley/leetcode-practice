/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/
 * <p>
 * Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.
 * <p>
 * After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).
 * <p>
 * Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
 * Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

     * Approach: It was a bit tricky, i couldn't solve this question earlier, came back after 1 month or so with fresh set of eyes.
     * The trick was to understand that here we have to do things to children
     * 1. Consume their result (update the left and right pointer, in case children gets deleted)
     * 2. Pass them something (whether they are a potential root node)
     * <p>
     * If a current node is a potential root candidate, check if it needs to be deleted, if not then add it to result list
     * if yes, then it's children are potential root candidates.
