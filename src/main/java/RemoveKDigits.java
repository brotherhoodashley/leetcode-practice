/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/
 * <p>
 * Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
 * The given num does not contain any leading zero.
 * <p>
 * Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
 * Output: "1219"
 * Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
 * <p>
 * Input: num = "10200", k = 1
 * Output: "200"
 * Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
 * <p>
 * Input: num = "10", k = 2
 * Output: "0"
 * Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

     * Approach: Greedy, Removal of characters will lead to a subsequence of the number, so we can reframe the question
     * as find lexicographically smallest subsequence after removing k characters from the string
     * <p>
     * We keep adding characters to a stack and pop from it only when we see a smaller character. Pop here signifies skipping
     * that character in the result because in subsequence we have two options, either pick the character or skip it.
     * If we see a smaller character to the right, it makes sense to try to start subsequence from it, rather than current character
