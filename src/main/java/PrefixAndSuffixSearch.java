/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/prefix-and-suffix-search/
 * <p>
 * Design a special dictionary which has some words and allows you to search the words in it by a prefix and a suffix.
 * <p>
 * Implement the WordFilter class:
 * <p>
 * WordFilter(string[] words) Initializes the object with the words in the dictionary.
 * f(string prefix, string suffix) Returns the index of the word in the dictionary which has the prefix prefix and the suffix suffix.
 * If there is more than one valid index, return the largest of them. If there is no such word in the dictionary, return -1.
 * <p>
 * Input
 * ["WordFilter", "f"]
 * [[["apple"]], ["a", "e"]]
 * Output
 * [null, 0]
 * <p>
 * Explanation
 * WordFilter wordFilter = new WordFilter(["apple"]);
 * wordFilter.f("a", "e"); // return 0, because the word at index 0 has prefix = "a" and suffix = 'e".

    /**
     * <pre>
     * Approach: Maintain two tries, one that stores prefixes and other that stores suffixes.
     * As trie only stores prefixes, prior to storing suffixes, reverse the word and then store in suffix trie
     *
     * So when asked to find a pattern, find that prefix in prefix trie as well as the suffix in suffix trie.
     * Perform DFS on both the tries to find all the valid indexes that satisfies the query.
     *
     * Now we need to find the largest index amongst the common indexes between these two sets.
     * This can be achieved by finding set intersection between those two, which is a costly operation (linear)
     * Time: ~470 ms
     *
     * We can optimize it a bit by avoiding the DFS operation by storing set<integer> of valid indexes directly at trie nodes
     * This is similar to {@link DesignSearchAutocompleteSystem}
     * Then we can perform set intersection between two sets. It times out.
     * The reason is the size of set stored at the nodes would be much larger in the timed out code, as we are storing lot of redundant information per node.
     * ie. if words are repeated ie. "apple", "apple", we would store {0,1} per every node but we are interested only in the latest node.
     * Trick to solve this would be to avoid duplicates ie. use a hashmap of <string, integer>, value being the latest index.
     * Using this trick gives AC in similar time as the reverse index code, however during actual interviews, it's very important to explain the interviewers
     * the trade off in both the approaches, as the reverse indexes is very beneficial if no of find operations highly exceeds no of insert operations
     *
     * Another approach is to just maintain one trie e.g consider apple
     * Store words like "e{apple", "le{apple", "ple{apple", "pple{apple", "apple{apple" i.e. maintain a reverse index
     * So if you query for prefix = app and suffix = le, search for "le{app" in trie
     * Space required will be much larger than my current implementation but there is always a trade off
     *
     * This was asked in Google onsite interview
     * See {@link PrefixAndSuffixSearchOptimized}
