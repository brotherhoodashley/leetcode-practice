/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/
 * <p>
 * Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order.
 * All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
 * For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
 * All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
 * You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
 * One must use all the tickets once and only once.
 * <p>
 * Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
 * Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
 * <p>
 * Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
 * Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
 * Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
 * But it is larger in lexical order.
