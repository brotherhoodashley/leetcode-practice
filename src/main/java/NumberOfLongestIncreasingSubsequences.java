/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.

public class NumberOfLongestIncreasingSubsequences {
    /**
     * Approach: Variant of longest increasing subsequence, apart from storing the length of the lis ending at index i, need to store the count of
     * subsequences which has length = lis ending at index i
     * <p>
     * Initially I stored all count of lis ending at any index, ie. a 2D DP for any index i, what is the count of lis of length 1, 2, 3 .. n
     * So if any a[i] < a[j], we can carry forward the count of let's say length 2 of i to length 3 of j
     * But it timed out
     * <p>
     * Then I thought why we need to store all the length, we are interested only in the longest increasing subsequence length, so why not store only that.
     * <p>
     * Took me some time to implement it but happy to implement it on my own.
