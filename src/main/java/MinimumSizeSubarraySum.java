 * <p>
 * Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s.
 * If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
 * <p>
 * Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
