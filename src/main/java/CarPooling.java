/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/
 * <p>
 * You are driving a vehicle that has capacity empty seats initially available for passengers.  The vehicle only drives east (ie. it cannot turn around and drive west.)
 * <p>
 * Given a list of trips, trip[i] = [num_passengers, start_location, end_location] contains information about the i-th trip:
 * the number of passengers that must be picked up, and the locations to pick them up and drop them off.
 * The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from your vehicle's initial location.
 * <p>
 * Return true if and only if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips.
 * <p>
 * Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
 * Output: false
