/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/campus-bikes/ Premium
 * <p>
 * On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.
 * <p>
 * Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (worker, bike)
 * pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the bike to that worker.
 * If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index;
 * if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index).
 * We repeat this process until there are no available workers.
 * <p>
 * The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.
 * <p>
 * Return a vector ans of length N, where ans[i] is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the i-th worker is assigned to.
 * <p>
 * Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
 * Output: [1,0]
 * Explanation:
 * Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].
 * <p>
 * Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
 * Output: [0,2,1]
 * Explanation:
 * Worker 0 grabs Bike 0 at first. Worker 1 and Worker 2 share the same distance to Bike 2, thus Worker 1 is assigned to Bike 2,
 * and Worker 2 will take Bike 1. So the output is [0,2,1].

     * Approach: Calculate distance between all pairs of workers and bikes (n^2) and sort them.
     * Initially I implemented a priority queue solution which gave TLE, then pushed all distances pair to an array and directly sorted it which got AC.
     * During sort take care to resolve conflicts, took a couple of attempts for me to figure it out during my initial implementation.
     * Start assigning bikes greedily and skip already assigned workers/bikes
     * <p>
     * Learnings -- Notice the range of the inputs, can use bucket sort if smaller range.
