/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack/
 * <p>
 * Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.
 * <p>
 * FreqStack has two functions:
 * <p>
 * push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
 * pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
 * If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * ["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
 * [[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
 * Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
 * Explanation:
 * After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:
 * <p>
 * pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
 * The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
 * <p>
 * pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
 * The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
 * <p>
 * pop() -> returns 5.
 * The stack becomes [5,7,4].
 * <p>
 * pop() -> returns 4.
 * The stack becomes [5,7].
