/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/ Premium
 * <p>
 * There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you.
 * You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language.
 * Derive the order of letters in this language.
 * <pre>
 * Input:
 * [
 *   "wrt",
 *   "wrf",
 *   "er",
 *   "ett",
 *   "rftt"
 * ]
 * Output: "wertf"
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 *   "z",
 *   "x"
 * ]
 * Output: "zx"
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 *   "z",
 *   "x",
 *   "z"
 * ]
 * Output: ""
 * Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
 * </pre>

    /**
     * Approach: Create a directed graph and perform a topological sort with cycle detection to detect invalid orderings
     * Provided words are sorted lexicographically i.e. the letters inside the word are not sorted only the words are.
     * So compare two words and find the first mismatch, create an edge from that mismatch.
     * <p>
     * Care must be taken to handle invalid cases like {"abcd", "abc"}
     * <p>
     * Also care must be taken to place characters at the end whose order have not been identified i.e {"ae", "afg"}
     * We can only confirm that e < g but we can't say anything about 'a' and 'g' so we can place them anywhere and return it
     * <p>
