/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/
 * <p>
 * There is a row of n houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green.
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 * <p>
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
 * Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * <p>
 * Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
 * Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.

     * I remembered ericto's hint to solve DP problem, what information is required at each state.
     * Here we need the house index and color being painted at that index.
