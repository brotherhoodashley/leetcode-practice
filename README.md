# leetcode-practice

Long road ahead. Lot of things to learn and become good at.

This personal repository contains all my solutions for LeetCode, and some other problems that I find interesting. I have
currently spent a year trying to solve LeetCode problems, and I personally believe in sharing my learnings, hence I have
made this repository public.

As an added bonus, I have also added my interview experiences for various companies I interviewed for.

For each problem, I have added my approach, related problems and learnings (either in comments or in git commit message)

**Comments and issues are welcome**. Feel free to raise an issue if you need more understanding or have found a bug in
the code.

# How should I use this repo?

1. If you are interested only in a specific LeetCode problem, then try to directly search the problem url. If I have
   solved it, then you should find the source-code, and the approach to solve the problem. I also try to tag related
   problems, which should help you up-solve problems. I personally find LeetCode suggestions for related problems
   sub-par.

2. If you only want tricky problems to solve, search for `*tricky*` in git commit messages. I always try to tag the
   problems correctly so that it can be referenced easily.
3. If you want my learnings from problems, search for `*learnings*` in git commit messages. I always try to add
   learnings in git commit message, if I have learnt something new by solving that problem.
